**Patternizer** is a CLI tool and container utility designed to bootstrap Validated Pattern repositories. It automatically generates the necessary `values-global.yaml` and `values-<cluster_group>.yaml` files by inspecting Git repositories, discovering Helm charts, and applying sensible defaults.

The tool provides both a standalone CLI and containerized execution for maximum flexibility and consistency across environments.

## Features

- üöÄ **CLI-first design** with intuitive commands and help system
- üì¶ **Container support** for consistent execution across environments
- üîç **Auto-discovery** of Helm charts and Git repository metadata
- üîê **Secrets integration** with Vault and External Secrets support
- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive testing** with unit and integration tests
- üèóÔ∏è **Multi-stage builds** for minimal container images
- üõ†Ô∏è **Makefile-driven development** for consistent local development and CI

## Quick Start for Developers

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/dminnear-rh/patternizer.git
cd patternizer

# Set up development environment
make dev-setup

# See all available targets
make help

# Build and test
make build
make test
```

---

## CLI Usage

### Available Commands

```bash
# Show help and available commands
patternizer help

# Initialize pattern files (without secrets)
patternizer init

# Initialize pattern files with secrets support
patternizer init --with-secrets

# Show help for the init command
patternizer init help
```

### Output Files

The `patternizer init` command generates:

- `values-global.yaml` - Global pattern configuration
- `values-<cluster_group>.yaml` - Cluster group-specific configuration
- `pattern.sh` - Utility script for pattern operations

When using `--with-secrets`:
- `values-secret.yaml.template` - Template for secrets configuration
- Modified `pattern.sh` with `USE_SECRETS=true` as default

---

## Container Usage

Use the prebuilt container from Quay without needing to install anything locally:

### Basic Initialization

```bash
# Navigate to your pattern repository
cd /path/to/your/pattern-repo

# Initialize without secrets
podman run --rm -it -v .:/repo:z quay.io/dminnear/patternizer init

# Initialize with secrets support
podman run --rm -it -v .:/repo:z quay.io/dminnear/patternizer init --with-secrets
```

---

## Example Workflow

1. **Clone or create a pattern repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/your-pattern.git
   cd your-pattern
   ```

2. **Initialize the pattern:**
   ```bash
   podman run --rm -it -v .:/repo:z quay.io/dminnear/patternizer init
   ```

3. **Review generated files:**
   ```bash
   ls -la values-*.yaml pattern.sh
   ```

4. **Install the pattern:**
   ```bash
   ./pattern.sh make install
   ```

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.24+
- Podman or Docker
- Git
- Make

### Quick Start

```bash
# Set up development environment (installs dependencies and tools)
make dev-setup

# Show all available targets
make help
```

### Common Development Tasks

```bash
# Build the CLI
make build

# Run all tests (unit + integration)
make test

# Run only unit tests
make test-unit

# Run only integration tests
make test-integration

# Build container image locally
make local-container-build

# Run full CI pipeline locally
make ci

# Quick feedback loop (format check, vet, build, unit tests)
make check
```

### Code Quality

The project uses comprehensive linting and formatting:

```bash
# Run all linting checks (gofmt, go vet, golangci-lint)
make lint

# Format code
make fmt

# Run individual lint checks
make lint-fmt     # gofmt check
make lint-vet     # go vet
make lint-golangci # golangci-lint
```

---

## Testing

### Unit Tests

The project includes comprehensive unit tests located in `src/*_test.go` and `src/internal/*/` packages:

**Core Functionality Tests:**
- Resource path resolution and environment variable handling
- Default values generation for global and cluster group configurations
- Secrets integration logic and template handling

**Helm Chart Discovery Tests:**
- `FindTopLevelCharts()` correctly identifies top-level Helm charts
- Properly skips sub-charts, hidden directories, and invalid chart structures
- `IsHelmChart()` validates chart structure (Chart.yaml, values.yaml, templates/)

**Pattern Processing Tests:**
- URL parsing for SSH, HTTPS, and HTTP Git repository formats
- Error handling for invalid or unsupported URL formats
- Field preservation during YAML processing (custom user fields are never overwritten)
- Proper merging of defaults with existing configuration files

**Field Preservation Verification:**
- Tests ensure that custom fields in `values-global.yaml` are preserved
- Tests verify that custom fields in cluster group values files are maintained
- Tests confirm that nested custom fields and arrays are properly handled

### Integration Tests

The integration test (`test/integration_test.sh`) validates the complete workflow:
- Clones the [trivial-pattern](https://github.com/dminnear-rh/trivial-pattern) repository
- Runs `patternizer init`
- Verifies generated files match expected output
- Ensures `pattern.sh` is created with correct configuration

Run integration tests locally:
```bash
# Run integration tests (automatically builds binary first)
make test-integration

# Or run all tests (unit + integration)
make test
```

## CI/CD Pipeline

The project uses a comprehensive CI pipeline with three stages that leverage the Makefile for consistency:

1. **Lint & Format**: `make lint` - Code quality checks with `gofmt`, `go vet`, and `golangci-lint`
2. **Build & Test**: `make build`, `make test-unit`, `make test-coverage`, `make test-integration`
3. **Container Build**: Multi-stage container build and push to Quay.io

All code must pass linting and tests before being merged or deployed.

The CI pipeline uses the same Makefile targets that developers use locally, ensuring perfect consistency between local development and CI environments. You can run the same checks locally with `make ci`.

---

## Architecture

The CLI is organized into focused packages following Go best practices:

**Main Package (`src/`):**
- `main.go` - Application entry point

**Command Package (`src/cmd/`):**
- `root.go` - Cobra CLI setup and root command
- `init.go` - Initialization command logic and orchestration

**Internal Packages (`src/internal/`):**
- `fileutils/` - File operations, resource management, and path resolution
- `helm/` - Helm chart discovery and validation
- `pattern/` - Core pattern processing, Git operations, and URL parsing
- `types/` - YAML structure definitions and default value constructors

**Key Design Principles:**
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each package has a single, well-defined responsibility
- **Testability**: All packages are thoroughly unit tested with comprehensive coverage
- **Field Preservation**: YAML processing preserves all user-defined custom fields
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with descriptive messages
- **Modularity**: Clean interfaces between packages for maintainability

This modular design makes the codebase maintainable, testable, and extensible.
